I looked through some different tutorials on how to make a timer that counts down in minutes and seconds.
These are links I viewed:
- https://answers.unity.com/questions/225213/c-countdown-timer.html
- https://pressstart.vip/tutorials/2018/07/20/45/building-a-timer.html

This is the link I ended up following to create the timer:
https://gamedevbeginner.com/how-to-make-countdown-timer-in-unity-minutes-seconds/

The tutorial I ended up picking explained the process step by step and was very clear. It is also a very simple/generic timer that can be used as a package in many different games.
