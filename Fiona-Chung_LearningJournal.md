I looked through some different tutorials on how to make a timer that counts down in minutes and seconds.
These are links I viewed:
- https://answers.unity.com/questions/225213/c-countdown-timer.html
- https://pressstart.vip/tutorials/2018/07/20/45/building-a-timer.html

This is the link I ended up following to create the timer:
- https://gamedevbeginner.com/how-to-make-countdown-timer-in-unity-minutes-seconds/

The tutorial I ended up picking explained the process step by step and was very clear. It is also a very simple/generic timer that can be used as a package in many different games.

For my third package I'm looking into making a bar that can be used as a bar for a game, using the Unity UI, that can be increased or decreased in value.

For a loading bar:

My last package will be a pickup package.
A simple pickup tutorial I have previously used for a project:

I used part of this tutorial to quickly set up some movement so that I could showcase that the pickups work:

When putting my packages together I got an error with my last package. The problem was with the Player script part of the example. I was able to solve it by changing the script name to PlayerMovement and then reassigning the character controller in the inspector. I will have to go back to my last package and repeat this process before the final submission.
